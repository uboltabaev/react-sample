                            One of the things that our clients love the most is the convenience of 
                            having a hair & makeup artist come to your home, hotel room or other 
                            required location. Since Makeup Palace is primarily a mobile makeup 
                            and hair service, without a salon location, it makes it possible to 
                            provide an affordable service.

                            Our Gold Coast makeup artists and hair stylists will go anywhere in 
                            the Gold Coast city with no additional travel fee. This means that 
                            you'll only be paying for your hair & makeup service, without having 
                            to pay an additional cost for the travel of the hair & makeup artist.
                        </p>

                            For services outside the Gold Coast, the travel costs are extremely 
                            reasonable and dependent on both date and location. Please enquire 
                            for travel costs outside of the Gold Coast city.

                            Owner Rosie Johnson is not only passionate about makeup, hair and beauty, 
                            but sheâ€™s also highly qualified and motivated. In addition to receiving 
                            diploma level qualifications, Rosie is continuously keeping up with industry 
                            knowledge and standards. In the last few years, she has worked on some 
                            exciting and career defining projects such as large commercial projects, 
                            TV shows and short films. In addition, Rosie has worked with multiple 
                            leading brands and high profile clients.

                            More importantly, Rosie genuinely cares about her clients. She chooses 
                            vegan and cruelty free, safe, professional standard products at Makeup Palace. 
                            She also believes that the most important part of being a hair and makeup 
                            artist is about understanding exactly what the client wants. It's not 
                            just about using quality products or being an incredible artist, 
                            it's about giving the best service to all clients.

                            Our mobile Gold Coast makeup artists and hair stylists make it convenient. 
                            You can be sure that we've had the experience to know exactly what is required 
                            and suitable to the occasion. Not every client is the same, so while the 
                            hair & makeup need to fit the occasion, it also needs to suit the client. 
                            We are happy to work with your wants and needs, but can also give suggestions 
                            on what we think will work best for your features.

                            without the worry of whether it will last until the end of your event. 
                            The products and professional techniques that are used have been tried and tested, 
                            but we are also constantly evolving to keep up with trends and new products.
