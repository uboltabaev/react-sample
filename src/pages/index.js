                            Our most common service is hair & makeup booked in one appointment. 
                            It really is the ultimate pamper session as well as the most cost effective 
                            solution. Hair & Makeup appointments booked as one sitting, will take approximately 
                            1.5 hours per person. For group bookings, additional experienced hair & makeup artists 
                            are available to assist on the day. Extra-long hair or up styles are an additional $10.
